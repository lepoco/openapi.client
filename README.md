# ‚òÑÔ∏è OpenAPI Client

[Created with ‚ù§ in Poland by lepo.co](https://dev.lepo.co/)  
OpenAPI Client is a toolkit that helps you create HTTP clients for external APIs based on their OpenAPI specifications. It simplifies the process of consuming and interacting with various web services. The project is developed and maintained by lepo.co and other community contributors.

## üëÄ What does this repo contain?

The repository contains NuGet package source code, which uses C# code generators that can be used to generate native C# API clients from YAML or JSON files.

## Gettings started

Define an Open API file as content in your  **.csproj** file.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">

  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFrameworks>net8.0</TargetFrameworks>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="OpenApi.Client" Version="1.0.0">
      <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
      <IncludeAssets>compile; build; analyzers</IncludeAssets>
    </PackageReference>
  </ItemGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <OpenApiContract Include="google.youtube.api.json" />
  </ItemGroup>

</Project>
```

Define your partial class as open api client

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// My YouTube Client.
/// </summary>
[OpenApiClient("google.youtube.api", false)]
public partial class YouTubeClient;
```

You can now use your generated client!

```csharp
IYouTubeClient client = new YouTubeClient(new HttpClient());

var subscribersCount = client.GetSubscribersCountAsync("mychannel", CancellationToken.None);
```
